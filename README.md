# Exquisite Corpse - C# Project

## Overview
The "Exquisite Corpse" project is a simple console-based application written in C# that allows the user to create quirky, random creatures by combining different heads, bodies, and feet. This is based on the popular "Exquisite Corpse" drawing game, where each part of the figure is created independently and then combined.

## Features
- Random creature generation: A creature's head, body, and feet are randomly selected from a list of possible options.
- Custom creature creation: The user can also manually choose specific parts to build a custom creature.

## How It Works
1. **Random Mode**: This mode selects a random head, body, and feet, and combines them to create a creature.
2. **Build a Creature**: Users can specify the head, body, and feet by name (e.g., ghost, bug, or monster).
3. **Switch Case Logic**: The `SwitchCase` method is used to handle different combinations and display the corresponding ASCII art for each part.
